# Baltimore shootings analysis

The Baltimore Sun conducted an analysis of Baltimore Police Department Part 1 Victim Based Crime Data posted on [Open Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij) on October 17, 2018. The report covers incidents between January 1, 2012, and October 13, 2018.

The analysis provided information for the October 18, 2018 Baltimore Sun story titled ["Baltimore's last weekend without a shooting was the weekend Freddie Gray was arrested"](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-violence-stats-20181018-story.html).

The Sun's findings and analysis are available in the "analysis" notebook in this repository, [`shootings_analysis.ipynb`]() (note: viewable on desktop).
